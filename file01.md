first , get is a high quality control system that can help you to connect your codes to the code editor while github is considerd as a cloud storage for your codes and work 

second, github is considered website that you can access by internet while get is a software that you install on you local system 

## ***the interaction betwween git and github***

we can summerize the connection between onto two things

### 1- cloning from github to get 
and that can happen using the clone command on the terminal :
```
read02$ git clone https://github.com/"username"/"repository name".git
```
after that you can use the command code . to open it on VS code 
```
read02$ code .
```
but make sure that you are in the right directory 

### 2- pushing from git to github 
after finishing the work on the code 
we can push it back to github to store it there 
and that can be done by 3 commands A C P 

first you need to use the add command
```
read-02a-02b[main !]$ git add . 
```
if there is no output that mean its okay 

then use the commit command
```
read-02a-02b[main !]$ git commit -m " write a helpfull massge here"
```
at the end use the push command to upload every thing to the github 
```
read-02a-02b[main !]$ git push origin name 
```
*and that it is*
